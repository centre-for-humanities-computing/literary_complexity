            "If you were to journey to the North of England, you would come to a valley that is surrounded by moors as high as mountains.",
            "It is in this valley where you would find the city of Bradford, where once a thousand spinning jennies that hummed and clattered spun wool into money for the long-bearded mill owners.",
            "That all mill owners were generally busy as beavers and quite pleased with themselves for being so successful and well off was known to the residents of Bradford, and if you were to go into the city to visit the stately City Hall, you would see there the Crest of the City of Bradford, which those same mill owners created to celebrate their achievements.",
            "It shows a sinister looking boar's head sitting on top of a well which seems puzzling at first, but the reason for this symbol is a matter of legend.",
            "There was once, legend has it, a fearsome boar, which lived in a wood located just outside the manor of Bradford.",
            "A source of great trouble to the local folk the boar was, bringing terror to the peaceful flocks and ravaging the countryside around.",
            "Even worse, however, the boar most liked to go to the well that was in the wood and drink its fresh water, so that the people of Bradford had second thoughts about visiting the well.",
            "That the people of Bradford bore the brunt of the beast's ferocity was unfair in the eyes of the people of the region.",
            "Eventually, the issue reached the ears of the kindly Lord of the Manor who the people had often asked for help.",
            "The Lord saw the severity of the problem the people faced and suggested a contest could solve the problem.",
            "He said that whoever could kill the boar and bring as proof its head to the Manor House would be rewarded with land and fame.",
            "It was the people of Bradford and the people who knew them who rejoiced at this proclamation but one question remained: who would kill the boar?",
            "By the handsome reward many felt tempted, but the thought of the boar with its deadly tusks and face like thunder soon put an end to their ambitions.",
            "However, there was one huntsman, who was still wet behind the ears, who decided the prize was worth a shot, in spite of the boar's reputation.",
            "The huntsman discovered the boar preferred to come out in the middle of the day.",
            "So he went to the wood by the well with his good bow, to bide his time.",
            "Around noontime, the boar, feared by the locals, came out, as slow as a snail, from among the trees, just as the huntsman had predicted.",
            "The huntsman leaped from his hiding place and through the heart with his fine arrows shot the boar.",
            "Now the problem was no longer to kill the boar.",
            "It was to find a way to carry the boar back.",
            "The head was too heavy for the little huntsman to carry back to the Manor House, but the huntsman, who was as quick-witted and cunning as ever, asked himself, 'What else can I do to prove I killed the boar?' The next instance he opened the boar's mouth and cut out its tongue, taking that as proof for the Lord.",
            "He set out for the Manor House as quickly as he could and he had only been gone a few minutes when a second huntsman, not so bold as the first but a little more cunning, came on the scene.",
            "Seeing the slain carcass of the boar, the huntsman rejoiced in his good fortune.",
            "The second huntsman knew a shortcut to the Manor House was just around the nearby pond, and, being a bigger man than the first, was able to pick up the boar's head and carry it through the wood towards the prize that awaited him.",
            "The Lord of the Manor was seated in his hall when the second huntsman burst through the door and began to spin a line.",
            "'The woes of Bradford are ended!' he announced.",
            "'With my own hand I have slain the boar!' And, with that, at the feet of his lord he dropped the boar's enormous head.",
            "'Then you will be rewarded, as I promised.' 'But first, let me examine the head of this monster,' said the Lord of the Manor.",
            "To not examine the head in advance had not been very clever on the part of the huntsman.",
            "Right away, the Lord noticed the tongue of the boar was missing and exclaimed, 'What is this?",
            "A boar with no tongue?' He looked at the huntsman, dubiously.",
            "'How come this creature has no tongue?' he demanded.",
            "All eyes were on the huntsman.",
            "The huntsman questioned by the Lord replied, 'I cannot say, my Lord.' He was suddenly realizing his tricky situation could end badly for him.",
            "Through the door at this moment, the first huntsman burst.",
            "'The woes of Bradford are ended!' he cried.",
            "'I have slain the boar the people of Bradford dreaded!' All eyes turned to the man who now stood in the doorway.",
            "'The reward is already given,' said the Lord of the Manor.",
            "'The man here has brought to me the boar's head.' 'Then where is its tongue?' the first huntsman replied.",
            "And, so saying, he drew out the boar's tongue he had put in his hunting pouch and related how he had ambushed the creature in the wood and cut out its tongue as proof of his victory.",
            "Listening to the tale, the Lord of the Manor tried to discern which huntsman was telling him the truth and what the two huntsmen were thinking as they waited for him to make a decision.",
            "Almost instantly, the Lord saw that the second huntsman had fed him a pack of lies and it was the first huntsman who was the true savior of Bradford.",
            "The Lord believed the second huntsman had tried to steal the first huntsman's prize and so proclaimed the first huntsman the true victor."

            "One of these was a merry little fellow named Aqua, who danced on the silver backs of the fishes as they plunged up and down in the waves, and, no matter how high he sprung, he always came down again into his mother's lap.",
            "His mother, you know, was the ocean, and very beautiful she looked that summer day in her dark blue dress and white ruffles.",
            "By and by, the happy water drop tired of his play, and looking up to the clear sky above him, thought he would like to have a sail on one of the white, marshmallow-like clouds, instead of spending his whole life in the ocean.",
            "Of the sky, little Aqua had always been afraid, but he decided to finally face his demons and suggested a solution involving the sun carrying him up to the sky would be ideal.",
            "The sun understood Aqua's request came from his heart, so he acquiesced and also took ever so many other drops, so that Aqua might not be lonesome on the way.",
            "It was only the sun that knew this, however, for all the other drops had been changed into fine mist or vapor and Aqua could not see them.",
            "Do you know what vapor is?",
            "If you breathe into the air, when it is cold enough, you will see it coming out of your mouth thick and fast like steam.",
            "When the vapor is quite near the earth, we call it 'fog'.",
            "Into vapor the water drops that danced in the ocean had been changed, because in their own shape they were too heavy for the sunbeams that the sun let out to carry.",
            "Higher and higher they sailed, and though it was grand, Aqua and his friends were like fish out of water, so they grew quite dizzy.",
            "They enjoyed looking down on the world below, while the wind scattered them across the four corners of the earth, but after a while it grew nearly time for the sun to go to bed.",
            "He became very red in the face, and began to sink lower and lower, until suddenly he went clear out of sight!",
            "Poor little Aqua, frightened by the impending cold and darkness, wished he could sleep not in the sky, but somewhere closer to earth.",
            "Then Aqua heard the wind blow and conjectured that maybe the wind could take him back down to the ocean.",
            "Indeed, the wind took pity on him and fanned him, together with all of his brothers and sisters, into a heavy gray cloud, after which he blew them apart and told them to hurry down, fast and furious to the earth, so they could have a fighting chance of reaching the ocean.",
            "Down they went, rolling over each other until with a patter and clatter and spatter they touched the ground, and all the people that the raindrops fell on cried, 'It's raining', and took out their umbrellas.",
            "Some of the drops that were the most fortunate, including Aqua, fell on a mountainside, and down the rocky cliff they ran.",
            "Together they plunged into a mountain brook, which came foaming and dashing along, leaping over rocks and rushing down the hillside, until in the valley below they heard the strangest clattering noise.",
            "The little water drops were then able to make out a flour mill that was standing on the bank.",
            "Inside the mill, the water drops saw two great stones, which the big wheel kept whizzing round and round.",
            "The stones, smoothed by the spinning, were busy grinding the wheat into flour and the corn into golden meal.",
            "But what giant do you suppose it was who could turn and swing that tremendous wheel?",
            "No giant at all.",
            "It was just our tiny little water drops, who sprang on it by hundreds and thousands, and whirled it over and over.",
            "It was lucky for the water drops that the brook where they were swimming next emptied into a beautiful pond where ducks and geese were living peacefully.",
            "Aqua liked to play hide-and-seek in this pond, and it was his brother water drop who he fooled by swimming to a big pool of water and pretending to hide there, but then sneaking under a rock into an obscured little puddle.",
            "His brother had blatantly peaked and even followed Aqua as he entered the big pool of water, so when he searched there and could not find him, he was extremely surprised and gave up.",
            "Aqua liked this pond where he could play all day, so he stayed a good while, sailing up and down, taking the ducks' backs for ships and the frogs for horses, but after a time he tired of the dull life, and he and his brothers floated under a bridge for a long distance, until they saw another brook tumbling down a hillside.",
            "'Come, let's join hands!' cried Aqua and because the water drops were all together, overcoming the brook was child's play.",
            "It was by the help of Aqua and his brothers that the bewitching river was able to float heavy ships, though not so long ago it was only a little stream.",
            "As the river grew wider and he could almost see the ocean, Aqua realized his journey was almost over and he had come full circle.",
            "Back in the ocean, he felt right at home."

            "It is you who must be our king because no one can fly as high as you.' 'Except me!' cried a shrill, shrill voice, and out of the blue the little bird without a name rose from the eagle's back, where he had lain hidden in the feathers.",
            "His guile was the ace up his sleeve, and he laughed to himself at how easy it had been to outwit the other birds.",
            "Higher and higher he mounted, until he was lost to sight, and then folding his wings together, he sank to earth crying shrilly, 'I am king, I am king!' The eagle tricked by the little bird had not sensed the bird in his feathers and so had not at all expected the bird to come flying out like that.",

            "No, no!",
            "You shall stay in the earth till you die of hunger!' So they shut up the little bird in the mouse's hole that the mouse gave up most unwillingly, and bade the owl watch him carefully night and day.",

            "Then the little bird guarded by the owl peeped out, and when he saw the owl's two eyes tight shut, he slipped from the hole and flew away.",
            "He wanted to shout, 'I am king' so that the owl could hear him as he flew, but thought better of it."

            "On the floor beside each other they sat, shuffling around the tank, looking all over the place and peering into the corners among the big pebbles and the pond weed.",

            "At one point she thought she saw him, but it wasn't the water snail.",
            "It was a large speck of dust that was deceptively bobbing around in the water like a live animal.",
            "They were ready to call it quits, when suddenly Mom cried, 'Ah ha!' Tucked in a curve of the archway, perfectly hidden against a pitch dark stone, sat Mr Sticky, safe and sound.",

            "Then she noticed another water snail was right next to Sticky and asked where this new addition to the family could have come from.",
            "'I'm beginning to suspect the pond weed is guilty, don't you think?' replied Mom.",
            "They both laughed and climbed into Abby's bed together and, though it was cozy, it was a bit of a squeeze.",
            "'Budge up,' Mom said, giving Abby a push with her bottom.",
            "'I can't because I'm already on the edge.' 'Good heavens, you've grown then."

            "The Roswell UFO Incident was the alleged recovery of extra-terrestrial debris, including alien corpses, from an object that crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, on or about July eighth, nineteen forty-seven.",
            "Since the late nineteen seventies, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and the subject of conspiracy theories as to the true nature of the object that crashed.",
            "The United States military maintains the debris recovered was from an experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon that belonged to a classified program named 'Mogul'.",
            "However, many UFO proponents maintain that, in fact, a crashed alien craft and bodies were recovered, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up.",
            "The incident has turned into a widely known pop culture phenomenon, making the name Roswell synonymous with UFOs.",
            "It ranks as one of the most publicized and controversial alleged UFO incidents.",
            "On July ninth, nineteen forty-seven, a press release that Roswell Army Air Field issued stated that personnel from the field's Bomb Group had recovered a crashed 'flying disc' from a ranch near Roswell, sparking intense media interest.",
            "Later the same day, the Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force stated that, in fact, a weather balloon had been recovered by the Roswell Army Air Field personnel, rather than a 'flying saucer'.",
            "A subsequent press conference was called, featuring debris from the crashed object that confirmed the weather balloon description.",
            "The case was quickly forgotten and almost completely ignored, even by UFO researchers, for more than thirty years.",
            "Then, in nineteen seventy-eight, nuclear physicist and author Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, the only person known to have accompanied the Roswell debris from where it was recovered to Fort Worth.",
            "Over the next few years, the accounts he and others gave elevated Roswell from a forgotten incident to perhaps the most famous UFO case of all time.",
            "By the early nineteen nineties, UFO researchers had interviewed several hundred people who had, or who claimed to have had, a connection with the events at Roswell in nineteen forty-seven.",
            "Additionally, hundreds of documents were obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests, as were some that insiders apparently leaked.",
            "Their conclusions were that at least one alien craft had crashed in the Roswell vicinity, that aliens, some possibly still alive, were recovered, and that a massive cover-up of any knowledge of the incident was put in place.",
            "Numerous books, articles, television specials and even a made-for-TV movie brought the nineteen forty-seven incident fame and notoriety, so that by the mid nineteen nineties, strong majorities in polls, such as a nineteen ninety-seven CNN Time poll, believed that aliens had visited earth and specifically that aliens had landed at Roswell and the government was covering up the fact.",
            "During the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties, a new narrative emerged which was at strong odds with what was reported in nineteen forty-seven.",
            "This narrative evolved over the years from the time the first book on Roswell was published in nineteen eighty, as many new witnesses and accounts emerged, drawn out in part by the publicity on the incident.",
            "Of the hundreds of witnesses that the various researchers interviewed, a seemingly impressive figure, a comparable few were true 'witnesses' who claimed to have actually seen debris or aliens.",
            "Most of these so-called witnesses were repeating the claims of others, and their testimony would be inadmissible hearsay in an American court.",
            "As for the several accounts from those who claimed to have seen aliens, critics identified a variety of problems with them.",
            "These problems ranged from the reliability of second-hand accounts, to serious credibility problems with witnesses making demonstrably false or internally-inconsistent claims, to dubious death-bed 'confessions' or accounts from elderly or easily confused witnesses.",
            "A basic problem with all the witness accounts, according to the critics, is that they all came a minimum of thirty-one years after the events in question, and in many cases were recounted more than forty years after the fact.",
            "Not only are memories this old of dubious reliability, they were also subject to contamination from other accounts the witnesses may have been exposed to.",
            "Though there had always been skeptics who had many objections to the plausibility of these accounts, it was not until the mid nineteen nineties that a strong counter-argument to the presence of aliens was widely publicized.",
            "The General Accounting Office launched an inquiry and directed the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force to conduct an internal investigation.",
            "The result was summarized in two reports.",
            "The first, released in nineteen ninety-five, concluded that the reported recovered material in nineteen forty-seven was likely debris from a secret government program called Project Mogul, which involved high altitude balloons meant to detect sound waves generated by Soviet atomic bomb tests and ballistic missiles."

            "Tulip mania was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed.",
            "At the peak of tulip mania in February sixteen thirty-seven, tulip contracts sold for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled craftsman.",
            "It is generally considered the first recorded economic bubble.",
            "The tulip, introduced to Europe in the mid sixteenth century from the Ottoman Empire, became very popular in the United Provinces, which we now know as the Netherlands.",
            "Tulip cultivation in the United Provinces is generally thought to have started in earnest around fifteen ninety-three, after the Flemish botanist Charles de l'Ecluse had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established a botanical garden, which is famous as one of the oldest in the world.",
            "There, he planted his collection of tulip bulbs that the Emperor's ambassador sent to him from Turkey, which were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the northern climate.",
            "It was shortly thereafter that the tulips began to grow in popularity.",
            "The flower rapidly became a coveted luxury item and a status symbol, and a profusion of varieties followed.",
            "They were classified in groups: one-colored tulips of red, yellow, or white were known as Couleren, but it was the multicolored Rosen (red or pink on white background), Violetten (purple or lilac on white background), and, to a lesser extent, the Bizarden (red, brown or purple on yellow background) that were the most popular.",
            "These spectacular and highly sought-after tulip bulbs would grow flowers with vivid colors, lines, and flames on the petals, as a result, it is now understood, of being infected with tulip-specific virus known as the 'Tulip breaking virus'.",
            "The Dutch Golden Age growers named their new varieties with exalted titles.",
            "Many early forms were prefixed with 'admiral', often combined with the growers' names.",
            "'General' was another prefix that found its way into the names of around thirty varieties.",
            "Later came varieties with even more superb names, such as even 'Admiral of Admirals' and 'General of Generals'.",
            "Most of these varieties have now died out, though similar 'broken' tulips continue in the trade.",
            "Tulips grow from bulbs, and can be propagated through both seeds and buds.",
            "Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after seven-twelve years.",
            "When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds.",
            "Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own.",
            "The 'tulip breaking' virus, which many botanists have studied, spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years.",
            "Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus.",
            "Tulips bloom in April and May for about a week, and the secondary buds appear shortly thereafter.",
            "Bulbs can be uprooted and moved about from June to September, and thus actual purchases occurred during these months.",
            "As the flowers grew in popularity, professional growers paid higher and higher prices for bulbs with the virus.",
            "By sixteen thirty-four, in part as a result of demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market.",
            "In sixteen thirty-six, the Dutch created a type of formal futures markets, which merchants used to sell and buy contracts to buy bulbs at the end of the season.",
            "Traders met at taverns and buyers were required to pay a fee per trade.",
            "People were purchasing bulbs at higher and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit.",
            "However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs.",
            "In February sixteen thirty-seven, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs.",
            "As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted.",
            "The speculative bubble burst.",
            "Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth a fraction of the price they had paid.",
            "The event was popularized in eighteen forty-one by the book 'Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds', that a British journalist Charles Mackay wrote.",
            "That crowds of people often behave irrationally was the main thesis of the book, and tulip mania was one of the primary examples.",
            "According to Mackay, at one point twelve acres of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb.",
            "He claims that many such investors ruined by the fall in prices were desperate, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock.",
            "In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators sought help from the government of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a ten percent fee.",
            "Attempts that were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties were unsuccessful.",
            "The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held at the end of the crash.",
            "No court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.",
            "Although Mackay's book is a classic that many publishing houses continue reprinting today, his account is contested.",
            "Many modern scholars believe the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described, with some arguing that the price changes may not have constituted a bubble.",
            "Research on the tulip mania is difficult because of the limited data from the sixteen thirties.",
            "However, some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices."

            "A source of great trouble to the local folk the boar was, bringing terror to the peaceful flocks and ravaging the countryside around.",
            "Even worse, however, the boar most liked to go to the well that was in the wood and drink its fresh water, so that the people of Bradford had second thoughts about visiting the well.",
            "That the people of Bradford bore the brunt of the beast's ferocity was unfair in the eyes of the people of the region.",
            "Eventually, the issue reached the ears of the kindly Lord of the Manor who the people had often asked for help.",
            "The Lord saw the severity of the problem the people faced and suggested a contest could solve the problem.",
            "He said that whoever could kill the boar and bring as proof its head to the Manor House would be rewarded with land and fame.",
            "It was the people of Bradford and the people who knew them who rejoiced at this proclamation but one question remained: who would kill the boar?",
            "By the handsome reward many felt tempted, but the thought of the boar with its deadly tusks and face like thunder soon put an end to their ambitions.",
            "However, there was one huntsman, who was still wet behind the ears, who decided the prize was worth a shot, in spite of the boar's reputation.",
            "The huntsman discovered the boar preferred to come out in the middle of the day.",
            "So he went to the wood by the well with his good bow, to bide his time.",

            "Now the problem was no longer to kill the boar.",
            "It was to find a way to carry the boar back.",
            "The head was too heavy for the little huntsman to carry back to the Manor House, but the huntsman, who was as quick-witted and cunning as ever, asked himself, 'What else can I do to prove I killed the boar?' The next instance he opened the boar's mouth and cut out its tongue, taking that as proof for the Lord.",
            "He set out for the Manor House as quickly as he could and he had only been gone a few minutes when a second huntsman, not so bold as the first but a little more cunning, came on the scene.",
            "Seeing the slain carcass of the boar, the huntsman rejoiced in his good fortune.",

            "To not examine the head in advance had not been very clever on the part of the huntsman.",
            "Right away, the Lord noticed the tongue of the boar was missing and exclaimed, 'What is this?",
            "A boar with no tongue?' He looked at the huntsman, dubiously.",

            "'The reward is already given,' said the Lord of the Manor.",
            "'The man here has brought to me the boar's head.' 'Then where is its tongue?' the first huntsman replied.",
            "And, so saying, he drew out the boar's tongue he had put in his hunting pouch and related how he had ambushed the creature in the wood and cut out its tongue as proof of his victory.",
            "Listening to the tale, the Lord of the Manor tried to discern which huntsman was telling him the truth and what the two huntsmen were thinking as they waited for him to make a decision.",
            "Almost instantly, the Lord saw that the second huntsman had fed him a pack of lies and it was the first huntsman who was the true savior of Bradford.",
            "The Lord believed the second huntsman had tried to steal the first huntsman's prize and so proclaimed the first huntsman the true victor.",
            "The Lord wondered for a moment why he always encountered so much chicanery in his everyday interactions.",
            "The huntsman who had earned his prize fair and square received as his reward a piece of land just outside the town, known thereafter as Hunt Yard.",
            "His fame was indeed assured, but it was not nearly as lasting as that of the fearsome Bradford Boar."

            "Of the sky, little Aqua had always been afraid, but he decided to finally face his demons and suggested a solution involving the sun carrying him up to the sky would be ideal.",
            "The sun understood Aqua's request came from his heart, so he acquiesced and also took ever so many other drops, so that Aqua might not be lonesome on the way.",

            "He became very red in the face, and began to sink lower and lower, until suddenly he went clear out of sight!",
            "Poor little Aqua, frightened by the impending cold and darkness, wished he could sleep not in the sky, but somewhere closer to earth.",
            "Then Aqua heard the wind blow and conjectured that maybe the wind could take him back down to the ocean.",
            "Indeed, the wind took pity on him and fanned him, together with all of his brothers and sisters, into a heavy gray cloud, after which he blew them apart and told them to hurry down, fast and furious to the earth, so they could have a fighting chance of reaching the ocean.",
            "Down they went, rolling over each other until with a patter and clatter and spatter they touched the ground, and all the people that the raindrops fell on cried, 'It's raining', and took out their umbrellas.",
            "Some of the drops that were the most fortunate, including Aqua, fell on a mountainside, and down the rocky cliff they ran.",
            "Together they plunged into a mountain brook, which came foaming and dashing along, leaping over rocks and rushing down the hillside, until in the valley below they heard the strangest clattering noise.",

            "It was lucky for the water drops that the brook where they were swimming next emptied into a beautiful pond where ducks and geese were living peacefully.",
            "Aqua liked to play hide-and-seek in this pond, and it was his brother water drop who he fooled by swimming to a big pool of water and pretending to hide there, but then sneaking under a rock into an obscured little puddle.",
            "His brother had blatantly peaked and even followed Aqua as he entered the big pool of water, so when he searched there and could not find him, he was extremely surprised and gave up.",
            "Aqua liked this pond where he could play all day, so he stayed a good while, sailing up and down, taking the ducks' backs for ships and the frogs for horses, but after a time he tired of the dull life, and he and his brothers floated under a bridge for a long distance, until they saw another brook tumbling down a hillside.",
            "'Come, let's join hands!' cried Aqua and because the water drops were all together, overcoming the brook was child's play.",
            "It was by the help of Aqua and his brothers that the bewitching river was able to float heavy ships, though not so long ago it was only a little stream.",
            "As the river grew wider and he could almost see the ocean, Aqua realized his journey was almost over and he had come full circle.",
            "Back in the ocean, he felt right at home.",
            "For him, this was the safest, sweetest place in the whole wide world.",
            "During the warm summer evenings, if you take a walk on the sea beach, you will hear the gentle rippling swash of the waves and some say that it must be the gurgling voices of Aqua and his brother water drops telling each other about their wonderful journey around the world."

            "Abby was a bundle of nerves as she descended the stairs.",
            "In the study, surrounded by books and papers, her mom was working and she looked impatient when she saw Abby in the doorway and even more worried when she heard the bad news.",
            "'He'll turn up,' Mom said, and that was that.",
            "Then, to add fuel to the flames, she raised her tone of voice and said dismissively, 'For the time being, go to bed, Abby.",
            "I've got masses of work to catch up on.' Abby had a quick temper and she was angry as hell.",
            "'You've hoovered him up, haven't you?' she said accusingly.",
            "Abby's mom denied Abby's version of the story was true and said that she was careful, but because Mr Sticky was so small he was hard to see.",
            "'What's wrong with being small?' 'Nothing at all, but it makes things hard to find.' 'Or notice,' Abby said, suddenly feeling like the small, overlooked Mr Sticky herself and storming from the room.",
            "The door to the bedroom opened a few minutes later and Mom's face appeared.",
            "She was there to try to make up for having been insensitive earlier.",
            "She had put her work on the back burner and occupied herself with Sticky.",
            "Abby, who was breathing fire all on account of the little snail, tried to ignore her, but it was hard when Mom walked over to the bed and sat next to her.",
            "Mom, who Abby still strained to remain upset with, had gone out to find her glasses in order to search for Sticky more effectively.",
            "'This is my new and extra powerful pair I have for important occasions like snail hunting,' she said.",
            "She smiled at Abby, trying to butter her up, but Abby didn't smile back.",
            "Abby believed her mom's idea would not succeed, but then she had an idea of her own.",
            "'I've got a magnifying glass,' Abby suddenly remembered and rushed off to find it.",
            "On the floor beside each other they sat, shuffling around the tank, looking all over the place and peering into the corners among the big pebbles and the pond weed.",
            "Abby tried to imagine, if she were Sticky, a little water snail, where would she hide out?",
            "At one point she thought she saw him, but it wasn't the water snail.",
            "It was a large speck of dust that was deceptively bobbing around in the water like a live animal.",
            "They were ready to call it quits, when suddenly Mom cried, 'Ah ha!' Tucked in a curve of the archway, perfectly hidden against a pitch dark stone, sat Mr Sticky, safe and sound.",
            "'You, I can always count on,' Abby said to her mom, with relief.",
            "Then she noticed another water snail was right next to Sticky and asked where this new addition to the family could have come from.",
            "'I'm beginning to suspect the pond weed is guilty, don't you think?' replied Mom.",
            "They both laughed and climbed into Abby's bed together and, though it was cozy, it was a bit of a squeeze.",
            "'Budge up,' Mom said, giving Abby a push with her bottom.",
            "'I can't because I'm already on the edge.' 'Good heavens, you've grown then.",
            "When did that happen?",
            "You could've put an elephant in here last time we did this.",
            "Before I know it, you'll be all grown up.' On her mom's chest Abby then put her head and smiled."

            "However, many UFO proponents maintain that, in fact, a crashed alien craft and bodies were recovered, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up.",
            "The incident has turned into a widely known pop culture phenomenon, making the name Roswell synonymous with UFOs.",
            "It ranks as one of the most publicized and controversial alleged UFO incidents.",
            "On July ninth, nineteen forty-seven, a press release that Roswell Army Air Field issued stated that personnel from the field's Bomb Group had recovered a crashed 'flying disc' from a ranch near Roswell, sparking intense media interest.",
            "Later the same day, the Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force stated that, in fact, a weather balloon had been recovered by the Roswell Army Air Field personnel, rather than a 'flying saucer'.",
            "A subsequent press conference was called, featuring debris from the crashed object that confirmed the weather balloon description.",
            "The case was quickly forgotten and almost completely ignored, even by UFO researchers, for more than thirty years.",
            "Then, in nineteen seventy-eight, nuclear physicist and author Stanton Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, the only person known to have accompanied the Roswell debris from where it was recovered to Fort Worth.",
            "Over the next few years, the accounts he and others gave elevated Roswell from a forgotten incident to perhaps the most famous UFO case of all time.",
            "By the early nineteen nineties, UFO researchers had interviewed several hundred people who had, or who claimed to have had, a connection with the events at Roswell in nineteen forty-seven.",
            "Additionally, hundreds of documents were obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests, as were some that insiders apparently leaked.",
            "Their conclusions were that at least one alien craft had crashed in the Roswell vicinity, that aliens, some possibly still alive, were recovered, and that a massive cover-up of any knowledge of the incident was put in place.",
            "Numerous books, articles, television specials and even a made-for-TV movie brought the nineteen forty-seven incident fame and notoriety, so that by the mid nineteen nineties, strong majorities in polls, such as a nineteen ninety-seven CNN Time poll, believed that aliens had visited earth and specifically that aliens had landed at Roswell and the government was covering up the fact.",
            "During the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties, a new narrative emerged which was at strong odds with what was reported in nineteen forty-seven.",
            "This narrative evolved over the years from the time the first book on Roswell was published in nineteen eighty, as many new witnesses and accounts emerged, drawn out in part by the publicity on the incident.",
            "Of the hundreds of witnesses that the various researchers interviewed, a seemingly impressive figure, a comparable few were true 'witnesses' who claimed to have actually seen debris or aliens.",
            "Most of these so-called witnesses were repeating the claims of others, and their testimony would be inadmissible hearsay in an American court.",
            "As for the several accounts from those who claimed to have seen aliens, critics identified a variety of problems with them.",
            "These problems ranged from the reliability of second-hand accounts, to serious credibility problems with witnesses making demonstrably false or internally-inconsistent claims, to dubious death-bed 'confessions' or accounts from elderly or easily confused witnesses.",
            "A basic problem with all the witness accounts, according to the critics, is that they all came a minimum of thirty-one years after the events in question, and in many cases were recounted more than forty years after the fact.",
            "Not only are memories this old of dubious reliability, they were also subject to contamination from other accounts the witnesses may have been exposed to.",
            "Though there had always been skeptics who had many objections to the plausibility of these accounts, it was not until the mid nineteen nineties that a strong counter-argument to the presence of aliens was widely publicized.",
            "The General Accounting Office launched an inquiry and directed the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force to conduct an internal investigation.",
            "The result was summarized in two reports.",
            "The first, released in nineteen ninety-five, concluded that the reported recovered material in nineteen forty-seven was likely debris from a secret government program called Project Mogul, which involved high altitude balloons meant to detect sound waves generated by Soviet atomic bomb tests and ballistic missiles.",
            "The second report, released two years later, in nineteen ninety-seven, concluded that reports of recovered alien bodies were likely a combination of innocently transformed memories of military accidents involving injured or killed personnel, innocently transformed memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies in military programs US conducted in the nineteen fifties, and hoaxes that various witnesses and UFO proponents perpetrated.",
            "The psychological effects of time compression and confusion about when events occurred explained the discrepancy with the years in question.",
            "In January nineteen ninety-seven, Karl Pflock, one of the more prominent pro-UFO researchers, said, 'Based on my research and that of others, I'm as certain as it's possible to be without absolute proof, that no flying saucer or saucers crashed in the general vicinity of Roswell or on the Plains of San Agustin in nineteen forty-seven.' He then added, 'The debris found was the remains of something very earthly, all but certainly something from the Top Secret Project Mogul.' Although most now agree with this conclusion, each year, during July Fourth weekend, the City of Roswell hosts the Roswell UFO Festival celebrating all things UFO, featuring prominent UFOlogists and discussions."

            "Tulip cultivation in the United Provinces is generally thought to have started in earnest around fifteen ninety-three, after the Flemish botanist Charles de l'Ecluse had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established a botanical garden, which is famous as one of the oldest in the world.",
            "There, he planted his collection of tulip bulbs that the Emperor's ambassador sent to him from Turkey, which were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the northern climate.",
            "It was shortly thereafter that the tulips began to grow in popularity.",
            "The flower rapidly became a coveted luxury item and a status symbol, and a profusion of varieties followed.",
            "They were classified in groups: one-colored tulips of red, yellow, or white were known as Couleren, but it was the multicolored Rosen (red or pink on white background), Violetten (purple or lilac on white background), and, to a lesser extent, the Bizarden (red, brown or purple on yellow background) that were the most popular.",
            "These spectacular and highly sought-after tulip bulbs would grow flowers with vivid colors, lines, and flames on the petals, as a result, it is now understood, of being infected with tulip-specific virus known as the 'Tulip breaking virus'.",
            "The Dutch Golden Age growers named their new varieties with exalted titles.",
            "Many early forms were prefixed with 'admiral', often combined with the growers' names.",
            "'General' was another prefix that found its way into the names of around thirty varieties.",
            "Later came varieties with even more superb names, such as even 'Admiral of Admirals' and 'General of Generals'.",
            "Most of these varieties have now died out, though similar 'broken' tulips continue in the trade.",
            "Tulips grow from bulbs, and can be propagated through both seeds and buds.",
            "Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after seven-twelve years.",
            "When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds.",
            "Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own.",
            "The 'tulip breaking' virus, which many botanists have studied, spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years.",
            "Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus.",
            "Tulips bloom in April and May for about a week, and the secondary buds appear shortly thereafter.",
            "Bulbs can be uprooted and moved about from June to September, and thus actual purchases occurred during these months.",
            "As the flowers grew in popularity, professional growers paid higher and higher prices for bulbs with the virus.",
            "By sixteen thirty-four, in part as a result of demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market.",
            "In sixteen thirty-six, the Dutch created a type of formal futures markets, which merchants used to sell and buy contracts to buy bulbs at the end of the season.",
            "Traders met at taverns and buyers were required to pay a fee per trade.",
            "People were purchasing bulbs at higher and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit.",
            "However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs.",
            "In February sixteen thirty-seven, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs.",
            "As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted.",
            "The speculative bubble burst.",
            "Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth a fraction of the price they had paid.",
            "The event was popularized in eighteen forty-one by the book 'Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds', that a British journalist Charles Mackay wrote.",
            "That crowds of people often behave irrationally was the main thesis of the book, and tulip mania was one of the primary examples.",
            "According to Mackay, at one point twelve acres of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb.",
            "He claims that many such investors ruined by the fall in prices were desperate, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock.",
            "In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators sought help from the government of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a ten percent fee.",
            "Attempts that were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties were unsuccessful.",
            "The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held at the end of the crash.",
            "No court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.",
            "Although Mackay's book is a classic that many publishing houses continue reprinting today, his account is contested.",
            "Many modern scholars believe the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described, with some arguing that the price changes may not have constituted a bubble.",
            "Research on the tulip mania is difficult because of the limited data from the sixteen thirties.",
            "However, some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices.",
            "For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high prices on the flower's introduction, which then fell dramatically.",
            "The high prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost, thus lowering the risk to buyers.",
            "Despite these disagreements about whether the phenomenon technically constituted an economic bubble, the term 'tulip mania' is still often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble, when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values."
